## Overview

A landing page with `header`, `main` and `footer` sections.

Mobile-first design was implemented.

The layout changes to a two-column grid for the desktop version using a media query.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

A mobile-first approach was followed.

The HTML was structured using semantic elements.

The use of CSS Grid changed the layout to a two-column grid for the desktop version using a media query.

The social icons were aligned using Flexbox.

Custom properties were used for the colors.

For the social icons, the [Ionicons](https://ionicons.com/) font library was used.

CSS nesting and the `&` nesting selector were used for the `focus`, `hover` and `active` states of the button and the social links.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- The basic structure of a small landing page.

- Embedding icons from a font library and styling them.

### Continued development

Further investigating the use of icons, font libraries and `.svg` files.
